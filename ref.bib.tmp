  abstract = {Background: Knowledge and awareness of blood pressure (BP) play an important role in the successful control of hypertension and prevention of hypertension-related complications. Objectives: The study is aimed at estimating the prevalence, knowledge, awareness, and attitudes of hypertension and its risk factors among pharmacists in Jos, Nigeria. Methods: A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted during the month of July 2013 among pharmacists in Jos metropolis using a self-administered questionnaire and BP measurement. Factors associated with hypertension knowledge, awareness and attitude were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test or student t-test as appropriate while multivariate regression assessed factors associated with hypertension. Results: In all, 200 pharmacists, median age 35 years (IQR 28-46 years), 72\% males participated in the study. The prevalence of hypertension was 8\%. Overall, 90\% of respondents had good knowledge of hypertension, while 82\% had a poor attitude towards hypertension. Inadequate hypertension related knowledge was an independent risk factor for stage 1 hypertension (adjusted odd ratio 10.9; 95\% confidence interval: 1.2-54.6), adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, marital status and length of employment. Conclusion A low prevalence and adequate knowledge of hypertension was observed among pharmacists in Jos, however, the attitude/awareness of hypertension was very poor. Interventions to improve awareness and reduce hypertension risk among pharmacists are needed.}

  abstract = {Hypertension has been reported to be a major problem of the blacks. There is a paucity of studies, however, on community-based surveys on the prevalence and pattern of hypertension in Nigeria in the recent time. This study sought to investigate the prevalence and pattern of hypertension in the adult population living in the ancient semiurban community of Ile-Ife, southwest Nigeria.Two thousand and ninety-seven adults of above 20 years of age were recruited into the door-to-door survey through a multistage cluster sampling technique. Diagnosis of hypertension was based on blood pressure (BP) threshold of 160/95 mmHg and the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension guidelines (Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines) definitions. Resting blood pressure was taken using electronic sphygmomanometer.The mean age and BP of the participants were aged 44.2 {$\pm$} 11.6 years and 127/77 mmHg, respectively. The participants (36.6\%) had a BP of greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg whereas 13.3\% had BP of greater than or equal to 160/95 mmHg. 22.1\% had isolated systolic hypertension whereas 14.5\% had isolated diastolic hypertension using the BP of greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg cut off-point. Using the BP of greater than or equal to 160/95 mmHg, isolated systolic hypertension and isolated diastolic hypertension were 6.63\%, respectively. A male-to-female ratio of 1.7:1 and 1:5 was observed for BP greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg and BP greater than or equal to 160/95 mmHg, respectively. Hypertension prevalence increased across age gradient from young to old adults.The prevalence estimates of hypertension obtained in this study was higher than those found in most earlier studies from Nigeria, other West Africa nations and for African\textendash Americans.

Abdominal obesity and increased body mass index are known to be associated with hypertension5, an important public health problem worldwide and the most widely recognized modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease (stroke) and end-stage renal disease.Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional communitybased study involving three hundred apparently healthy men aged 20 years and above to determine the prevalence of generalized and abdominal obesity and their association with hypertensionResults: The prevalence of abdominal and generalised obesity was 16.7\% and 12.7\% respectively. The prevalence of hypertension was 46.7\%. Abdominal obesity (measured as waist circumference {$\geq$} 120) had a stronger association with hypertension than generalized obesity(measured as BMI {$\geq$}30 kg/m2).Conclusion: The prevalence of generalized and abdominal obesity among urban men is high. Abdominal obesity is strongly associated with hypertension. The need for public health actions to reverse this trend cannot be over emphasized.Keywords: Abodominal obesity, Generalized Obesity, Hypertension, Men, Urban},

  abstract = {Improved understanding of the current burden of hypertension, including awareness, treatment, and control, is needed to guide relevant preventative measures in Nigeria. A systematic search of studies on the epidemiology of hypertension in Nigeria, published on or after January 1990, was conducted. The authors employed random-effects meta-analysis on extracted crude hypertension prevalence, and awareness, treatment, and control rates. Using a meta-regression model, overall hypertension cases in Nigeria in 1995 and 2020 were estimated. Fifty-three studies (n~=~78~949) met our selection criteria. Estimated crude prevalence of pre-hypertension (120-139/80-89~mmHg) in Nigeria was 30.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 22.0\%-39.7\%), and the crude prevalence of hypertension ({$\geq$}140/90~mmHg) was 30.6\% (95\% CI: 27.3\%-34.0\%). When adjusted for age, study period, and sample, absolute cases of hypertension increased by 540\% among individuals aged {$\geq$}20~years from approximately 4.3 million individuals in 1995 (age-adjusted prevalence 8.6\%, 95\% CI: 6.5-10.7) to 27.5 million individuals with hypertension in 2020 (age-adjusted prevalence 32.5\%, 95\% CI: 29.8-35.3). The age-adjusted prevalence was only significantly higher among men in 1995, with the gap between both sexes considerably narrowed in 2020. Only 29.0\% of cases (95\% CI: 19.7-38.3) were aware of their hypertension, 12.0\% (95\% CI: 2.7-21.2) were on treatment, and 2.8\% (95\% CI: 0.1-5.7) had at-goal blood pressure in 2020. Our study suggests that hypertension prevalence has substantially increased in Nigeria over the last two decades. Although more persons are aware of their hypertension status, clinical treatment and control rates, however, remain low. These estimates are relevant for clinical care, population, and policy response in Nigeria and across Africa.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the prevalence of individual cardiometabolic risk factors, total cardiovascular risk scores, and total type 2 diabetes risk scores among corporate workers in Abuja, Nigeria. Using purposive and simple random sampling techniques, 184 white-collar workforces above the age of 40 years were randomly selected for the study. Three (3) standardized research instruments were used for data collection, namely: the WHO STEPwise Approach to Chronic Disease Risk Factor Surveillance Questionnaire (r=0.74), WHO/ISH Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction Charts (r=64), and Finnish Diabetes Risk Score Questionnaire (r=0.77). Chi-square was used to test the seven (7) research hypotheses at P {$\leq$} 0.05 level of significance. The result of the study revealed that although 98.9\% of the participants are aware of healthy living, only 9.2\% consumes fruits/vegetables regularly; 42.9\% still add salt directly to their food after cooking; 23.4\% currently uses tobacco products; 18.4\% are passive smokers; while the majority (64.1\%) do not engage in adequate moderate-intensity physical activities. On biometric measurement, 57.1\% were overweight/obese; 48.4\% had unhealthy waist circumference; 33.7\% had elevated blood pressure; 3.3\% had high random blood sugar; while 28.8\% had high total blood cholesterol. Also, 8.8\% of the participants had high (20-29.9\%) to extremely high ({$\geq$} 40\%) total cardiovascular risk scores, while 14.4\% had high to very high total Type 2 diabetes risk scores. All the results were statistically significant. The study concluded that the prevalence of individual and total cardio-metabolic risks is significantly high among corporate workers in Abuja. The study, therefore, recommended that every corporate organization should have well-designed workplace health promotion policies and programmes which will afford the workforce the opportunity to be appropriately educated on healthy lifestyle, their risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the different available measures to mitigate such risk.},

Interviewer administered semi \textendash{} structured questionnaires were used to collect information on respondents socio-demographic characteristics, past medical history, nutritional status (using dietary recall), and behaviors related to lifestyle. A general physical examination was done and anthropometric measurements taken from each respondent. The examinations collected data on, blood pressure, weight and height. Blood specimen (5 ml whole blood) was collected from each respondent for laboratory tests such as random blood sugar (RBS) and serum cholesterol levels. Data from the clinical examinations and laboratory tests were then used to categorize respondents as hypertensive, diabetic, obese and hyperlipidemic. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20 and level of significance was set at p values {$<$} 0.5. A total of 426 respondents participated in the survey of which 64.8\% were between 40 -59 years with a mean age of 51.7 {$\pm$} 11.9 years. A high proportion (81.7\%) of respondents had formal education. Most of the respondents (95\%) claimed to be employed. About 51.4\% of the respondents reported history of substance use. The most commonly consumed by respondents were ``bitter kola'' (31.7\%) and ``kolanut'' (9.9\%). About 5\% of respondents either smoked or took substances containing nicotine e.g. ``snuff ``. Nearly a quarter, 23.2\% of respondents claimed that they have ever used herbal (traditional) medicine (23.2\%) to take care of health issues as the need arises. About 9.2\% of respondents claimed that they occasionally consumed alcoholic drinks. About 49.5\% of the respondents were found to have poor medical history. While majority (73.9\%) of the respondents had normal blood pressure (BP), 12.0\% and 14\% were either pre-hypertensive or hypertensive. Majority of the respondents, 61.2\%, were reported obese with a BMI exceeding 25. About 63.4\% of respondents had high serum cholesterol while 2.1\% reported smoking habit.

Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of hypertension and associated factors among the residents of Yemetu community in Ibadan-North Local Government Area of Oyo State, Nigeria. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional design was used. The study involved 806 respondents aged from 18-90 years from 171 households, selected by cluster sampling technique. It was a house-to-house survey. Behavioural risk factors were measured using World Health Organisation (WHO) STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance (STEPS 1 \& 2). Hypertension was defined as Systolic blood pressure (SBP) {$\geq$} 140 and/or Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) {$\geq$} 90mm Hg or currently on anti-hypertensive medication. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square and binary logistic regression tests at P{$<$}0.05. Results: The overall prevalence of hypertension was 33.1\% (male 36.8\% and female 31.1\%). The proportion of self reported hypertension was 11.1\%, while 5.1\% were currently on anti-hypertensive medication. The mean age of the respondents was 38.8 {$\pm$}15.6 years. The body mass index of the respondents was 5.2\%, 52.0\%, 29.5\% and 13.3\% for underweight, normal, overweight and obese, respectively. Alcohol and tobacco use were found in 11.5\% and 3.2\%, respectively. The result of binary logistic regression analysis revealed that hypertension was significantly associated with being in age groups 30-49 years (OR 2.258, 95\% CI: 1.311 - 3.884), {$\geq$}50 years (OR 7.145, 95\% CI: 3.644 - 14.011), being overweight or obese (OR 2.281, 95\% CI: 1.022 \textendash{} 5.088). Hypertension was inversely associated with being underweight (OR 0.537, 95\% CI: 0.395 \textendash{} 0.832). Conclusion: This study revealed a high prevalence of hypertension.

However, the role of pre-hypertension in CKD is yet to be fully studied in our environment. OBJECTIVES: We set out to determine the magnitude of pre-hypertension and traditional CKD risk factors. We also determined their relationships to proteinuria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted in two urban local government areas (Akure South and Ondo West) in Ondo State, Southwest Nigeria in March 2014. A total of 1,183 adults (M:F, 0.63:1) were studied. Their bio-data, history of cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, herbal usage, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), diabetes and hypertension were obtained. A total of 1,183 adults (M:F, 0.63:1) blood pressure (BP) and anthropometry were determined. Urinalysis was conducted using Combi-Uriscreen\textregistered{} 10SL. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0. RESULTS: A total of 1183 adults (M:F, 1:1.6) were studied with a mean age of 44.7\,{$\pm$}\,17.4 years. Their mean systolic BP, diastolic BP and body mass index were 129.6\,{$\pm$}\,23.7 mmHg, 79.8\,{$\pm$}\,14 mmHg and 26.2\,{$\pm$}\,5.8\,kg/m2, respectively. Pre-hypertension was present in 32.3\% of the subjects, while hypertension was present in 43.4\% of the subjects; 6.2\% gave history of diabetes, 4.5\% smoked cigarette, 68.3\% used herbs and 44.1\% used NSAIDs. Proteinuria was present in 25.9\% of the subjects, while haematuria was present in 1.7\% of the subjects. BP and age showed significant association to proteinuria. CONCLUSION: Pre-hypertension and known risk factors of CKD are prevalent in the people of Ondo State, Nigeria. Individuals with persistent pre-hypertension should be routinely screened for CKD and referred to the Nephrologist for early intervention.},

  abstract = {There is a need for regular surveillance on the prevalence of hypertension, as evidence suggest an increase among rural dwellers. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of hypertension among residents of Alakio community, Lafia East Development Area, Nasarawa State, Nigeria. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study of rural communities of Alakio. A simple random method was used in this case study. Eligible persons were recruited into the study by spinning a bottle in the middle of a town hall, and the street the head pointed to was recorded. This process was repeated until sample was completed, with structured questionnaires administered and physical measurement were performed. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) {$\geq$}140-159/90-99mmHg for stage I hypertension and {$\geq$}160/100mmHg for stage II hypertension. There were 299 respondents of which 47.69\%, 24.08\%, 14.72\% and 43.04\% were between ages of 18-29yrs, 30-39yrs, 40-49yrs and 50yrs respectively. The overall prevalence of hypertension in the community was 13.38\%, with male dominance to female. For the respondents, 68.89\% had normal blood pressure and 18.73\% were found to be pre-hypertensive. The prevalence risk factors in respondents that consume alcohol to those who do not were 41.47\% and 58.53\% respectively. A similar trend in the prevalence risk factor was also observed for smokers and non-smokers at 84.95\% and 15.05\% respectively Respondents that use extra salt in their foods and those who do not were 55.18\% and 44.82\% respectively. Creating awareness about the disease as well as regular blood pressure check and other medical practices which discourages sedentary lifestyle, would be more valuable in preventing the occurrence and high incidence of this disease. Health education by means of medical outreaches should be held regularly to address the damage associated with hypertension and to create awareness on the risk factors leading to hypertension.},

This study sought to determine the impact of prehypertension (PHT) on QT dispersion and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in adult black Nigerians. Methods One hundred and one subjects with office blood pressure (BP) {$<$} 140/90 mmHg were categorised according to their office BP into normotensive (BP {$<$} 120/80 mmHg, n = 57) and prehypertensive (BP 120\textendash 139/80\textendash 89 mmHg, n = 44) groups. Echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) were performed on the subjects. Results Thirty-four males aged 53.65 {$\pm$} 16.33 years and 67 females aged 52.42 {$\pm$} 12.00 years were studied. The mean QT interval dispersion (QTd) of the normotensive (38.96 {$\pm$} 11.06 ms) and prehypertensive (38.41 {$\pm$} 11.81 ms) groups were similar (p = 0.81). Prehypertensive subjects had higher left ventricular mass (LVM) (165.75 {$\pm$} 33.21 vs 144.54 {$\pm$} 35.55 g, p = 0.024), left ventricular mass index 1 (LVMI-1) (91.65 {$\pm$} 16.84 vs 80.45 {$\pm$} 18.65 g/m2, p = 0.021) and left ventricular mass index 2 (LVMI-2) (54.96 {$\pm$} 10.84 vs 47.51 {$\pm$} 12.00 g/m2.7, p = 0.017). QTd was independent of echocardiographic and electrocardiographic LVH (p {$>$} 0.05). Conclusion Compared with normotension, prehypertension is associated with higher LVM but similar QTd. This suggests that structural remodelling precedes electrical remodelling in prehypertension.},

We assessed some traditional cardiovascular risk factors and lifestyle choices that may predispose to CVDs in medical doctors in a tertiary health facility in Southern Nigeria. Study design Cross-sectional study Participants and methods One hundred sixty-nine apparently healthy medical doctors were recruited. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to gather data on CVD risk factors. Anthropometric and blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken. Results Majority were males (68.0\%), aged 20\textendash 39 years (43.8\%), single (62.7\%), and house officers (58.0\%) with{$<$}1 year (48.5\%) work experience. Over half were either overweight or obese. While 77.2\% of those not centrally obese were males, only about 22.8\% of females did not meet the criteria for central obesity (P-value {$<$} 0.05). While respondents had BP in prehypertensive (48.2\%), stage 1 (18.5\%), or stage 2 hypertension (3.6\%) ranges, only 7.7\% had a previous diagnosis of hypertension. Only 25.4\% took fruits on a daily basis and engaged in aerobic exercises up to 30 minutes daily or at least 3\textendash 5 times a week. Other poor lifestyle choices included non-lean meat intake (76.8\%), low water intake (88.2\%), and junk food and soda drinks intake (daily 28\%, weekly 51.2\%). Conclusion Findings of a high prevalence of overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, and junk food intake and low fruits intake among doctors is worrisome. There is a need to educate doctors on adopting healthier lifestyles to reduce risk of CVDs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:The objective of the study was to assess the public health burden of hypertension in the rural communities in southeastern Nigeria (Niger Delta region of Nigeria).DESIGN/SETTING:The study was a cross-sectional study in three rural communities in the Cross River and Akwa Ibom States of Nigeria. Demographic, anthropometric information, prior history of hypertension or stroke in each participant or their parents was obtained with a questionnaire. Height, weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of respondents were measured by standard methods, and body mass index calculated.RESULT:The N of respondents was 3869; 1608 (41.6\%) males, 2261 (58.4\%) females; 1120 (29.0\%) Efiks, 1877 (48.5\%) Ibibio/Annangs, and 872 (22.5\%) Obolos. Mean SBP and DBP were significantly higher in males than in females (P {$<$} .001). Prior awareness of hypertension was 2.8\%. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 914 (23.6\%); 31.2\% males and 18.1\% females (P {$<$} .001). The prevalence of hypertension in the ethnic groups was 479 (25.5\%) among Ibibio/Annangs; 287 (25.6\%) among the Efiks and 130 (14.9\%) among the Obolos. Prehypertension occurred in 17.2\% of total population, 17.5\% males and 16.9\% females (P = .66).CONCLUSION:Hypertension is already a major public health burden in rural communities of these two states, despite a very low incidence of obesity and cigarette smoking.Ethn Dis. 2012;22[3]:335\textendash 339},

  abstract = {Background The prevalence of hypertension in Nigeria is high and growing. The burden and risk factor distribution also vary by geographical zone. Information about prevalence, risk factors and disease status awareness are needed to guide evidence based public health response at the national and sub- national levels. Purpose This paper describes the prevalence of hypertension and its correlates, as well as hypertension status awareness among men in North Central, Nigeria. Methods A cross sectional survey was administered to male partners of pregnant women participating in the Healthy Beginning Initiative program from 2016\textendash 2018. Information on socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors, physical measurement and blood pressure readings were collected using a standardized protocol. Data was analyzed with simple and multiple logistic regression. Results The 6,538 men had a median age of 31 years [IQR: 26\textendash 37]. The prevalence of hypertension was 23.3\% (95\% CI: 22.3\%-24.4\%), while 46.7\% had prehypertension. The odds of hypertension was associated with increasing age (OR:1.02, CI:1.01\textendash 1.03), being overweight (aOR:1.5,CI:1.3\textendash 1.8), being obese (aOR:2.6,CI:2.0\textendash 3.3), living in an urban area (aOR:1.6,CI:1.2\textendash 2.1), and alcohol use in the 30 days prior (aOR:1.2,CI:1.1\textendash 1.4). Overall, 4.5\% (297/6,528) of participants had ever been told they have hypertension. Among the 23.3\% (1,527/6,528) with hypertension, 7.1\% (109/1,527) were aware of their disease status. Men aged 41\textendash 50 years (aOR: 1.8, CI: 1.0\textendash 3.3), and {$>$} 50 years (aOR: 2.2, CI: 1.1\textendash 4.3), had higher odds disease status awareness. Living in an urban area was associated with lower odds (aOR: 0.2, CI: 0.03\textendash 0.7) of hypertension status awareness. Conclusion This study showed that hypertension is already a significant public health burden in this population and that disease awareness level is very low. Alcohol use and obesity were associated with hypertension, highlighting some modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors that are prevalent in the study population. Taken together, these findings can inform the design of interventions for primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention in Nigeria and similar settings.},

Data are limited on the temporal changes in the prevalence of prehypertension and risk factors for hypertension and cardiovascular disease among US adults with prehypertension. We analyzed data from 30 958 US adults {$\geq$}20 years of age who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys between 1999 and 2012. Using the mean of 3 blood pressure (BP) measurements from a study examination, prehypertension was defined as systolic BP of 120 to 139 mm Hg and diastolic BP {$<$}90 mm Hg or diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg and systolic BP {$<$}140 mm Hg among participants not taking antihypertensive medication. Between 1999\textendash 2000 and 2011\textendash 2012, the percentage of US adults with prehypertension decreased from 31.2\% to 28.2\% (P trend=0.007). During this time period, the prevalence of several risk factors for cardiovascular disease and incident hypertension increased among US adults with prehypertension, including prediabetes (9.6\% to 21.6\%), diabetes mellitus (6.0\% to 8.5\%), overweight (33.5\% to 37.3\%), and obesity (30.6\% to 35.2\%). There was a nonstatistically significant increase in no weekly leisure-time physical activity (40.0\% to 43.9\%). Also, the prevalence of adhering to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension eating pattern decreased (18.4\% to 11.9\%). In contrast, there was a nonstatistically significant decline in current smoking (25.9\% to 23.2\%). In conclusion, the prevalence of prehypertension has decreased modestly since 1999\textendash 2000. Population-level approaches directed at adults with prehypertension are needed to improve risk factors to prevent hypertension and cardiovascular disease.},

Data analysed statistically were significant at P {$<$} 0.05. 143 (26.8\%), 197 (36.9\%), and 194 (36.3\%) of the traders had normotension, pre-HTN and HTN (stages 1 and 2), respectively. All indices tested except HDLC were significantly different among BP groups (P {$<$} 0.05). Waist to hip (WHR) and waist to height (WHT) ratios were significantly different between HTN groups (P {$<$} 0.05). HTN was associated with MS and female gender (P {$<$} 0.05). Metabolic alterations and significant HTN were observed. Treatment of the individual components of the syndrome and improvement of modifiable metabolic factors may be necessary to reduce MS and high BP.},

This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations.

  abstract = {Objective. Prevalence of hypertension is on the rise and can be attributed to aging populations and changing behavioral or lifestyle risk factors. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence, awareness, treatment, control, and risk factors of hypertension in the middle part of Ghana. Methods. A total of 2,555 participants aged {$\geq$}18 years (mean age of 43 years; 60.5\% female) were enrolled using a two-stage sampling method. The World Health Organization STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor Surveillance-Instrument v2.1 was used for data collection. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were assessed. Blood glucose and lipids were also measured using blood samples collected after an overnight fast. Results. Prevalence of hypertension was 28.1\% (95\% CI: 26.3\%\textendash 29.8\%). Less than half, i.e., 45.9\% (95\% CI: 42.2\%\textendash 49.6\%), of the respondents were aware of their hypertensive status. Of those aware and had sought medical treatment, 41.3\% (95\% CI: 36.1\textendash 46.8) had their hypertension controlled. Risk factors associated with being hypertensive were current () and past tobacco usage (), prediabetes (), high body mass index (), hyperglycaemia (), and hypercholesterolaemia (). Doing vigorous work and being active in sports were less associated with being hypertensive (). Conclusion. Our study showed that close to one-quarter of adults who were involved in the survey in the middle belt of Ghana were hypertensive with less than half being aware of their hypertensive status; nearly half of those on treatment had controlled hypertension. Healthcare systems need adequate resources that enable them to screen, educate, and refer identified hypertensive patients for appropriate management to prevent or minimize the development of hypertension-related complications.},

Closely related to it is pre-hypertension, a category between hypertension and normotension which is believed to be a forerunner to hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Hypertension has been on the increase in recent times, even in rural communities which were previously less affected. The study was carried during the world health day as a screening exercise to determine the prevalence of hypertension and its associated factors in a rural community.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Ogboloma village, a small rural community in Bayelsa State, Ngeria Consecutive sampling of all eligible participants who presented for the screening exercise was done. Socio-demographic data, clinical history, anthropometry and blood pressure were taken. Data was stored and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0.Results: One hundred and thirty-one participants completed the study. There were 49(37.4\%) males. The prevalence of hypertension was 50.4\% while pre-hypertension was found in another 41.2\%. Factors associated with hypertension on univariate analysis were age (p {$<$}0.001) body mass index (p=0.038) waist hip ratio (p=0.008) hyperglycemia (p=0.030) and smoking (p=0.009) However, only age (p=0.004) and smoking (p=0.037) remained significant on multivariate analysis.Conclusions: Hypertension and Pre-hypertension were highly prevalent in this rural community. Age and smoking were significant predictors of hypertension. Hypertension screening and control programmes should therefore target rural communities and smokers.},

With obesity cut-off of {$>$}27 kg/m2, 22\% of the total subjects were obese, representing 9.5\% and 12.5\% of the male and female, respectively relative to total subject, but 9.19 \% and 24.75 \% in the males and females relative to total by sex. The highest prevalence was in the 21-23 age group (total = 50.00 \%; male = 52.63 \% and female = 48.00 \%). Based on the body mass index (BMI) cut-off, higher males (94.74\%) than females (88.0\%) were overweight whereas based on the total body fat (TBF) class, higher females (17, 68.0\%) than males (10, 52.63\%) were obese. Based on waist to hip ratio (WHPR) all females (but no male) were in the lower risk class. However, high proportion of either sex was in the desired/normal class based on systolic blood pressure (SBP) (Total = 59.09\%, female =56.00\%; male =.63.16\%), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (Total = 68.18\%; female = 68.0\%; male = 68.42\%) and blood glucose level (BGL) Total =65.90\%; female = 76.00\%; male = 52.63\%). Thus, the obesity prevalence was higher in the females and highest in the 21-23 age group indicating apparent risk of developing obesity-related diseases particularly in the females and 21-23 age group of the studied population.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. DESIGN: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. RESULTS: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. CONCLUSIONS: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution.},

The nature of the correlations has, however, remained a subject of scientific enquiry, especially when BP phenotypes are disaggregated and obesity is determined by a variety of methods. This study examined the relationship between obesity and BP in young-adult Nigerians. A total of 1610 subjects (53.9\% females) were recruited from five universities in the Igbo-speaking part of Nigeria. Relevant BP and anthropometric data were obtained following standard protocols. Appropriate statistical tools were used for data analyses. The results show that 42.2\% (49.5\% males, 36.1\% females) and 13.3\% (15.2\% males, 11.6\% females) of the population had point prehypertension and hypertension, respectively. By body mass index (BMI) standards, 20.6\% (12.4\% males, 27.5\% females) of the population were overweight/obese. Despite the weak positive and significant correlations between BP and the measures of obesity in both males and females in the general population (r = +0.110 to +0.261; p \&lt; 0.05), the correlations were found to exist essentially in normotensives, taper in the prehypertensives, and disappear (or became negative) among hypertensives. When analysed along weight status lines, a discordant relationship was found between the sexes. Overall, the relationship between blood pressure and measures of obesity is not linear throughout the BP spectrum. Clearly the said relationship is not a `straitjacket affair'.},

  abstract = {Objective Prehypertension appears to be a precursor of hypertension and has been recognised as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recognition of prehypertension provides important opportunities for preventing hypertension and CVD. We aimed to investigate the world-wide prevalence and heterogeneity of prehypertension. Methods We performed a meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies worldwide that reported the prevalence of prehypertension. We searched for publications between January 1966 and November 2010, using PubMed, Ovid and the Cochrane Library, with the keyword `prehypertension', supplemented by a manual search of references from recent reviews and relevant published original studies. Pooled prevalence of prehypertension was calculated using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Twenty-two articles met our inclusion criteria, with a total sample of 242 322 individuals. Results The overall pooled prevalence of prehypertension was 38\%. Significant heterogeneity across estimates of prevalence was observed (p = 0.000, I2 = 99.9\%). The prevalence rose as the sample size increased, and was higher among men than women (41 vs 34\%). The non-Asian population was more likely to be prehypertensive than Asian individuals (42 vs 36\%). A high prevalence of 47\% was observed among the black African population in the non-Asian subgroup. The inception year of the surveys was the only source of heterogeneity we found by meta-regressional analysis (p = 0.06). Conclusion These results indicate that the prevalence of prehypertension was relatively high, particularly among males. Although more attention has been paid to this segment of the population since 2003, additional practical and reasonable steps should be taken to prevent and treat prehypertension.},

  abstract = {Background of the study: Globally, lifestyle modification as a veritable tool of preventing various non-communicable diseases is a current topic in the medical world. Efforts to regulate nutrition and maintain optimal body shape and statistics are being widely encouraged. A study of anthropometric and nutritional status of adults in peaceful environments will be helpful in extrapolating its consequences in conflicts periods. This will enable adequate preventive measures to be established to enhance appropriate intervention. Objectives: To determine the socio-demographic, waist-hip ratio and body mass index of adults in a normal population. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of adults between 20 to 60 years of age was undertaken in an oil-producing non-conflict environment of Delta North senatorial district of Nigeria. The study recruited 432 eligible consented healthy adults using multistage sampling methods after ethical approvals were obtained from relevant authority and community leaders. Socio-demographic factors, blood pressure, waist-hip ratio and body mass index were determined using appropriate instruments and methods. Results: The results were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences SPSS version 18. The statistical significance was set at p˂0.05. It showed the prevalence of obesity, stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension among the subjects to be 16.7\%, 13.7\% and 5.3\% respectively. Conclusion: The study concluded that there is a high prevalence of obesity and pre-hypertension even in rural communities. This calls for concern because these are "precursors" of serious cardiovascular diseases with its attendant high morbidity and mortality.}

Eligible studies were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria for meta-analysis using Stata software and RevMan software.ResultsTwenty-one published studies were finally included. The results showed that the incidence of prehypertension was 37\% in Chinese adults. The pooled SMD (95\% confidence interval [CI]) was 0.37 (0.29-0.46) for body mass index, 0.20 (0.12-0.27) for fasting blood glucose (FPG), 0.17 (0.15-0.19) for total cholesterol (TC), 0.22 (0.17-0.27) for triglyceride (TG), 0.13 (0.10-0.15) for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and -0.07 (-0.16-0.02) for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). For smoking, drinking and family history of hypertension, the pooled OR (95\% CI) were 1.44 (1.40-1.47), 1.60 (1.44-1.79), and 1.19 (1.04-1.35), respectively.ConclusionThe incidence of prehypertension among adults in mainland China is relatively high, especially in males. BMI, FBG, TC, TG, LDL-C, smoking, drinking and family history of hypertension are positively related to prehypertension, and early intervention is recommended to reverse these modifiable risk factors.},

Outcomes Stroke and IHD mortality rates were plotted against countries' specific prevalence data. Results Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher in England than in the USA and Canada in all age\textendash gender groups. Mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was similar in the three countries before age 50 and then fell more rapidly in the USA, being the lowest in the USA. Only 34\% had a BP under 140/90\hspace{0.25em}mm\hspace{0.25em}Hg in England, compared with 50\% in the USA and 66\% in Canada. Prehypertension and stages 1 and 2 hypertension prevalence figures were the highest in England. Hypertension prevalence ({$\geq$}140\hspace{0.25em}mm\hspace{0.25em}Hg SBP and/or {$\geq$}90\hspace{0.25em}mm\hspace{0.25em}Hg DBP) was lower in Canada (19{$\cdot$}5\%) than in the USA (29\%) and England (30\%). Hypertension awareness was higher in the USA (81\%) and Canada (83\%) than in England (65\%). England also had lower levels of hypertension treatment (51\%; USA 74\%; Canada 80\%) and control ({$<$}140/90\hspace{0.25em}mm\hspace{0.25em}Hg; 27\%; the USA 53\%; Canada 66\%). Canada had the lowest stroke and IHD mortality rates, England the highest and the rates were inversely related to the mean SBP in each country and strongly related to the blood pressure indicators, the strongest relationship being between low hypertension awareness and stroke mortality. Conclusions While the current prevention efforts in England should result in future-improved figures, especially at younger ages, these data still show important gaps in the management of hypertension in these countries, with consequences on stroke and IHD mortality.},

Nigeria has witnessed tremendous socio-economic changes and rural to urban migration culminating in emergence of NCD. The impact of these diseases on the lives of people is enormous when measured in terms of outcomes. We initiated a screening program among inhabitants of Sokoto metropolis in an attempt to unravel the prevalence and pattern of NCD.Methods: This is a descriptive cross sectional study involving 535 participants who were randomly selected during World Kidney Day Screening in Sokoto. Health promotion talk was organized for the participants before commencing the screening. We took anthropometric measurements and calculated body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio for all individuals. We also checked blood pressure and blood glucose levels and performed urinalysis for all participants.Results: There were 535 participants including 332 males and 203 females with a mean age of 37{$\pm$}17 years. Over-weight, obesity and morbid obesity were found in 12.3\%, 6.7\% and 0.9\% of participants respectively. About 11\% had waist/hip ratio greater than 1. The prevalence of pre-hypertension and hypertension was 8.5\% and 30.2\% respectively. Elevated random blood glucose levels were found in 6\% of participants while 17.9\% had at least 1+ of proteinuria in urinalysis.Conclusion: Non-communicable diseases are common in our environment and the level of awareness is low. Regular health education and screening programs are necessary in order to reduce the menace.Key words: Non- communicable disease; Prevalence; Screening; Sokoto},

  abstract = {The purpose of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of {$>$}140 mmHg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP (DBP); beginning at 115/75 mmHg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mmHg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90 percent lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (SBP 120\textendash 139 mmHg or DBP 80\textendash 89 mmHg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions, which are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP ({$<$}140/90 mmHg, or {$<$}130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease); for patients whose BP is {$>$}20 mmHg above the SBP goal or 10 mmHg above the DBP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will only be controlled if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Raised blood pressure is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease. We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. METHODS: For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure. FINDINGS: We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19{$\cdot$}1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127{$\cdot$}0 mm Hg (95\% credible interval 125{$\cdot$}7-128{$\cdot$}3) in men and 122{$\cdot$}3 mm Hg (121{$\cdot$}0-123{$\cdot$}6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78{$\cdot$}7 mm Hg (77{$\cdot$}9-79{$\cdot$}5) for men and 76{$\cdot$}7 mm Hg (75{$\cdot$}9-77{$\cdot$}6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24{$\cdot$}1\% (21{$\cdot$}4-27{$\cdot$}1) in men and 20{$\cdot$}1\% (17{$\cdot$}8-22{$\cdot$}5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1{$\cdot$}13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence. INTERPRETATION: During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.

Materials and Method: A cross sectional study was conducted among 304 undergraduates who were sampled using a multi-stage sampling technique. A self-administered questionnaire was structured using the WHO STEPS Instrument. The data was analyzed for magnitude of correlation using Spearman's rho (rs) and Chi-square tests using 1BM Results: Among the 304 undergraduates, 179 (58.9\%) were females while 125(41.1\%) were males, this difference in proportion was statistically significant (X2 =6.066, P =0.0140).The mean age of the participants was 24{$\pm$}3.45. The prevalence of hypertension was 14(4.6\%) and 135(44.4\%) were found to have pre-hypertension. Isolated Systolic Hypertension was identified in 3.6\% of the participants. Prevalence of Overweight \& Obesity was 50(16.4\%) and 14(4.3\%) respectively. A significant association exist between BP and gender of participants ({$\chi$}2 =31.345, p{$<$}0.001), BMI and gender ({$\chi$}2 =16.688, p=0.001). Also a strong positive correlation between BP and alcohol consumption (ᴦs=0.106, p=0.006) and between BP and high salt intake (ᴦs=0.188, p=0.001) were detected. Alcohol consumption and high salt intake was identified in 176(57.9\%) and 94(30.9\%) of the participants respectively. Conclusions: A high prevalence of elevated Blood Pressure and overweight was observed among the participants. Alcohol intake, high salt intake and being a female gender were predictors of rising blood pressure and overweight. An interventional program is needed to control these risk factors in this young population.},

  abstract = {Context: Apparently healthy young people are frequently regarded as free from such chronic diseases as hypertension, but reports from many parts of the world show that both hypertension and prehypertension are prevalent among young people.Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the pattern of blood pressure among apparently healthy young people in Abakaliki.Methods: Cross-sectional survey of 215 subjects aged between 15 and 24 years, screened and analysed for systolic and diastolic hypertension as well as systolic and diastolic prehypertension. Reference intervals were also derived from the mean and Standard Deviation values.Result: There is a highly significant sex difference (p=0.000) in the mean Systolic Blood Pressure (114.71{$\pm$}13.46mmHg for males versus 108.56{$\pm$}9.99mmHg for females). The prevalence of systolic hypertension was 3.3\% as against 2.3\% for the diastolic hypertension (using the WHO/ISH guidelines for the classification of hypertension). With the Reference Interval derived from the study the prevalence of systolichypertension was also 3.3\% while the diastolic hypertension was 4.3\%. The prevalence of systolic prehypertension was 28.8\%, as against 16.3\% for the diastolic prehypertension.Conclusion: The high prevalence of systolic and diastolic prehypertension is of clinical significance because virtually all these will eventually progress to frank hypertension on follow-up. Being diagnosed early implies that early intervention with lifestyle modification will eventually reduce the prevalence of hypertension in the adults. In view of limited resources in developing countries, this will provide a more cost effective approach tothe control of hypertension in the community than the treatment of established hypertension in adult life.Key Words: Blood pressure, pattern; Prehypertension; Hypertension; Young people.},

  abstract = {Background Evidence from previous studies has consistently revealed that patients develop target organ damage even with seemingly normal blood pressure thus informing the development of a new treatment guideline in 2017. The prevalence of hypertension in Nigeria ranges from 8-45\%, however this is expected to change due to the new guideline. Thus, this study sought to estimate the prevalence of hypertension based on 2017 ACC/AHA clinical guidelines, and determine its associated factors. Methods In this cross-sectional study a total of 296 participants were recruited with a simple random technique using a table of random numbers. Blood pressure, weight and height were measured and data was analysed with SPSS version 22. The primary outcome measures included proportion of respondents with hypertension based on AHA guideline and JNC 7 classifications, as well as the association between hypertension and BMI, age, sex and marital status. Results The mean age of study participants was 38.71years, and male to female ratio was 2:3. Overall prevalence of hypertension was 63.5\% and 22.6\% based on the new guideline and JNC 7 classification respectively; higher risk of hypertension was significantly associated with the AHA guideline (p{$<$}0.001). Association between body mass index, marital status (currently married/not married), sex, age group ({$\geq$}40 vs. {$<$}40years) and systolic as well as diastolic hypertension was significant (p{$<$}0.001). Females were more than twice as likely to be hypertensive as males [OR: 2.51 (1.54 - 4.10)]. Age and weight were the only significant predictors of abnormal blood pressure, diastolic and systolic hypertension. Conclusion Prevalence of hypertension based on the new guideline is staggeringly high and portends a huge public health problem. This conundrum requires immediate intervention in order to forestall the damaging effects of hypertension on vital body organs and for participants to lead a healthy life. Resumen Antecedentes La evidencia de los estudios previos ha revelado, consistentemente, que los pacientes desarrollan da\~nos en los \'organos diana aun cuando su presi\'on arterial es aparentemente normal, lo cual ha impulsado el desarrollo de una nueva gu\'ia de tratamiento en 2017. La prevalencia de la hipertensi\'on en Nigeria oscila del 8 al 45\%, aunque est\'a previsto que cambie, debido a esta nueva gu\'ia. En nuestro estudio calculamos la prevalencia de la hipertensi\'on, basada en la gu\'ia cl\'inica de ACC/AHA de 2017, y determinamos sus factores asociados. M\'etodos En este estudio transversal reunimos a un total de 296 participantes mediante una t\'ecnica aleatoria simple, utilizando una tabla de n\'umeros aleatorios. Medimos la presi\'on arterial, el peso y la altura, y analizamos los datos con SPSS versi\'on 22. Las medidas del resultado primario incluyeron la proporci\'on de respondedores hipertensos, bas\'andonos en la gu\'ia AHA y en la clasificaci\'on JNC 7, as\'i como en la asociaci\'on entre hipertensi\'on e IMC, edad, sexo y estado civil. Resultados La edad media de los participantes del estudio fue de 38,71 a\~nos, siendo el ratio var\'on:mujer de 2:3. La prevalencia global de la hipertensi\'on fue del 63,5\% y del 22,6\%, sobre la base de la nueva gu\'ia y la clasificaci\'on JNC 7, respectivamente. El mayor riesgo de hipertensi\'on se asoci\'o significativamente a la gu\'ia AHA (p{$<$}0,001). La asociaci\'on entre \'indice de masa corporal, estado civil (actualmente casados/solteros), sexo, grupo de edad ({$\geq$}40 vs. {$<$}40 a\~nos), e hipertensi\'on sist\'olica y diast\'olica fue significativa (p{$<$}0,001). Las mujeres superaron en m\'as del doble a los varones, en cuanto a la probabilidad de padecer hipertensi\'on [OR: 2,51 (1,54 - 4,1)]. La edad y el peso constituyeron los \'unicos factores predictivos significativos de presi\'on arterial anormal e hipertensi\'on diast\'olica y sist\'olica. Conclusi\'on La prevalencia de la hipertensi\'on basada en una nueva gu\'ia es asombrosamente elevada, presagiando un gran problema de salud p\'ublica. Este interrogante requiere una intervenci\'on inmediata, a fin de prevenir los efectos da\~ninos de la hipertensi\'on en los \'organos vitales, y animar a los participantes a llevar una vida sana.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the prevalence of prehypertension and cardiovascular function in prehypertensive students of the College of Health Sciences, Okofia, Nnewi, Nigeria. A total of 210 apparently healthy respondents aged 18-28, were recruited for the initial screening. Their blood pressure readings and body mass index (BMI) were obtained, whereas 5mls of blood sample was collected from 18 prehypertensive and 19 normotensive subjects. Lipid profile was assayed using enzymatic method, while serum magnesium was analyzed using Xylidyl blue method. Results showed a comparatively low prehypertensive prevalence rate of 11.4\%, with higher percentage in males (12.12\%) than in females (10.81\%). The mean values of BMI, SBP and DBP in prehypertensives (26.34.8, 126.75.8mmHg, 79.66.6mmHg) were significantly higher compared with values in normotensives (21.32.4, 107.79.1mmHg, 69.57.4mmHg) respectively (P\&lt;0.05). However, there was no significant difference in age of prehypertensives and normotensives (24.22.3 vs 24.02.2; P\&gt;0.05). HDL cholesterol and Mg were lower in prehypertensives (1.190.11mmol/l vs 1.270.11mmol/l; 1.600.65mmol/l vs 2.110.53mmol/l; P\&lt;0.05) respectively; but no significant difference in TG, TC and LDL between the groups (P\&gt;0.05). Importantly this preliminary study did show that TC, TG, and LDL still remained normal and this may be due to the age of the subject.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous studies that evaluated the prevalence, awareness and treatment of hypertension in Nigeria were either localized to some specific regions of the country or non-standardized thereby making evaluation of trend in hypertension care difficult. Methods: We used the World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise approach to chronic disease risk factor surveillance to evaluate in a nationally representative sample of 4192 adult Nigerians selected from a rural and an urban community in one state in each of the six geo-political zones of the country. Results: The overall age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 38.1\% and this varied across the geo-political zones as follows: North-Central, 20.9\%; North-East, 27.5\%; North-West, 26.8\%; South-East, 52.8\%; South-South, 44.6\%; and South-West, 42.1\%. Prevalence rate did not differ significantly (p {$>$} 0.05) according to place of residence; 39.2\% versus 37.5 \%; urban vs rural. Prevalence of hypertension increased from 6.8\% among subjects less than 30 years to 63.0\% among those aged 70 years and above. Awareness was better (62.2\% vs. 56.6\%; P = 0.0272); treatment rate significantly higher (40.9 \% vs. 30.8\%; P {$<$} 0.0001) and control similar (14 vs. 10.8\%) among urban compared to rural residents. Women were more aware of (63.3\% vs. 52.8\%; P {$<$} 0.0001); had similar (P {$>$} 0.05) treatment (36.7 vs. 34.3\%) and control (33.9\% vs. 35.5\%) rates of hypertension compared to men. Conclusion: Our results suggest a large burden of hypertension in Nigeria and a closing up of the rural-urban gap previously reported. This calls for a change in public health policies anchored on a primary health care system to address the emerging disease burden occasioned by hypertension.},

This study was thus conducted to investigate the prevalence of selected modifiable CVD risk factors and socio-demographic factors associated with them, among nurses in Nigeria. Materials and methods: This study was a cross-sectional survey involving 316 (298 females and 18 males) nurses, purposively recruited from the largest teaching hospital in Nigeria. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the AUDIT-C Alcohol Screening Questionnaire were used to assess the physical activity and alcohol consumption levels of the participants respectively. Participants' height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure were assessed using standard procedures. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics of Chi-square at 0.05 level of significance. Results: There was high prevalence and clustering of physical inactivity, obesity and pre-hypertension among the participants. Significant association was found between age and blood pressure (p{$<$}0.001), age and BMI (p{$<$}0.001), sex and physical activity level (p=0.041), sex and alcohol consumption (p{$<$}0.001), professional rank and blood pressure (0.038) and between professional rank and BMI (p{$<$}0.001). Conclusion: Findings from this study showed high prevalence of CVD risk factors: obesity, pre-hypertension abnormal waist-hip ratio and insufficient physical activity levels among participants. These factors were variedly associated with participants' age, professional rank and sex. There is a need for an urgent intervention to ameliorate CVD risks among nurses in Nigeria.}

  abstract = {Background Rising prevalence of cardiovascular disease requires in-depth understanding of predisposing factors. Studies show an association between air pollution and CVD but this association is not well documented in southern Nigeria where the use of biomass fuels (BMF) for domestic purposes is prevalent. Purpose This study aimed to explore the association between household BMF use and blood pressure (BP) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) among rural-dwelling women. Methods A cross-sectional study of 389 women aged 18 years and older. Questionnaires were used to obtain data on predominant fuel used and a brief medical history. Wood, charcoal and agricultural waste were classified as BMF while kerosene, bottled gas and electricity were classified as non-BMF. Blood pressure and CIMT were measured using standard protocols. Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between fuel type and BP, CIMT, pre-hypertension and hypertension after adjusting for confounders. Results There was a significant difference in the mean (standard deviation) systolic BP (135.3, 26.7 mmHg vs 123.8, 22.6 mmHg; p {$<$} 0.01), diastolic BP (83.7, 18.5 mmHg vs 80.1, 13.8 mmHg; p = 0.043) and CIMT (0.63, 0.16 mm vs 0.56, 0.14 mm; p = 0.004) among BMF users compared to non-BMF users. In regression analysis, the use of BMF was significantly associated with 2.7 mmHg higher systolic BP (p = 0.040), 0.04 mm higher CIMT (p = 0.048) in addition to increased odds of pre-hypertension (OR 1.67 95\% CI 1.56, 4.99, P = 0.035) but not hypertension (OR 1.23 95\% CI 0.73, 2.07, P = 0.440). Conclusion In this population, there was a significant association between BMF use and increased SBP, CIMT and pre-hypertension. This requires further exploration with a large-scale longitudinal study design because there are policy implications for countries like Nigeria where a large proportion of the population still rely on BMF for domestic energy.},

An upsurge of cardiovascular diseases has been reported in women. Studies on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in women in our environment appear to be few. Cultural and religious practices in Nigeria suggest that risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol consumption may be negligible in women. However, National data on cardiovascular diseases in Nigerian women is presently lacking mainly due to poor research funding. The available data are from hospital-based studies. This study sought to determine the prevalence and pattern of the various cardiovascular risk factors in a cohort of apparently healthy women living in a rural part of Nigeria., The study was a descriptive cross-sectional study of 137 apparently healthy women residing in a rural community Anambra state. Questionnaires were used to obtain demographic data. Physical activity was assessed with a modified World Health Organization (WHO) Step questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements were taken for each subject. Fasting plasma glucose and serum total cholesterol levels were measured., It was found that prevalence cardiovascular risk factors are high in rural communities in South East Nigeria. The risk is high even in middle-aged pre-menopausal women. Obesity and hypertension were found to be the driving force behind this increase. It is suggested that a current national survey for cardiovascular risk factors be done urgently as there appears to be an explosive increase in the prevalence of risk factors for CVD.},

Materials and Methods: We recruited 898 apparently healthy subjects (318 males and 580 females) of the Igbo ethnic group resident in Enugu (urban), Southeast Nigeria. Data collection was done using the World Health Organization Stepwise approach to Surveillance of risk factors (STEPS) instrument. Subjects had their weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, systolic and diastolic blood pressures measured according to the guidelines in the step 2 of STEPS instrument. Generalized obesity and hypertension were defined using body mass index (BMI) and JNC 7 classifications, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative variables were analyzed using t-test and Chi-square analysis, respectively, while the performance of WC and WHR was compared using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. P value was set at {$<$}0.05. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 48.7 (12.9) years. Central obesity was found in 76.9\% and 66.5\% of subjects using WHR and WC, respectively. WC had a significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) than WHR in all the cardiovascular risk groups, namely, generalized obesity (AUC = 0.88 vs. 0.62), hypertension alone (AUC = 0.60 vs. 0.53), and both generalized obesity and hypertension (AUC = 0.86 vs. 0.57). Conclusion: WC performed better than WHR in predicting the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Being a simple index, it can easily be measured in routine clinic settings without the need for calculations or use of cumbersome techniques.},

As high blood pressure (BP) is a common global cardiovascular (CV) disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality, the relationship between gradients of BP and other CV risk factors was assessed in Abia State, Nigeria. Methods Using the WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance of chronic disease risk factors, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey in Abia state, Nigeria from August 2011 to March 2012. Data collected at various steps included: demographic and behavioral risk factors (Step 1); BP and anthropometric measurements (Step 2), and fasting blood cholesterol and glucose (Step 3). Results Of the 2983 subjects with complete data for analysis, 52.1\% were females and 53.2\% were rural dwellers. Overall, the distribution of selected CV disease risk factors was diabetes (3.6\%), hypertension (31.4\%), cigarette smoking (13.3\%), use of smokeless tobacco (4.8\%), physical inactivity (64.2\%) and being overweight or obese (33.7\%). Presence of hypertension, excessive intake of alcohol, smoking (cigarette and smokeless tobacco) and physical inactivity occurred more frequently in males than in females (p{$<$}0.05); while low income, lack of any formal education and use of smokeless tobacco were seen more frequently in rural dwellers than in those living in urban areas (p{$<$}0.05). The frequency of selected CV risk factors increased as BP was graded from optimal, normal to hypertension; and high BP correlated with age, gender, smokeless tobacco, overweight or obesity, annual income and level of education. Conclusion Given the high prevalence of hypertension in this part of Nigeria, there is an urgent need to focus on the reduction of preventable CV risk factors we have observed to be associated with hypertension, in order to effectively reduce the burden of NCDs in Africa.},

  abstract = {Background: The prevalence of hypertension is on the increase in Nigeria. Prehypertension is considered a precursor of hypertension and a predictor of excessive cardiovascular risk. Identifying individuals with prehypertension and initiating effective measures will aid in reducing the incidence and prevalence of hypertension in our environment. The aim of this study was to quantify the magnitude of prehypertension and determine its associations among adults in a representative semi-urban Nigerian population. Methods: A cross-sectional study which was carried out in a semi-urban setting in Southeast Nigeria. Blood pressure (BP) was measured using the standard methods. A cardiovascular risk factor screening based on physical characteristics, individual medical, and family history of participants was done. Results: There were a total of 389 participants comprising 223 (57.3\%) males and 116 (42.7\%) females; male:female ratio been 1.9:1. The prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension were 45.5\% and 37.8\%, respectively. Males were significantly more likely to have prehypertension than females (61\% vs. 39\% respectively; OR = 1.32, P = 0.03). There was a weak positive significant correlation between age and both systolic (r = 0.16, P {$<$} 0.01) and diastolic (r = 0.12, P = 0.02) blood pressures. Up to 72.6\% of individuals with prehypertension have abnormal body mass index (BMI). While up to 8.5\% of the participants had a family history of cardiovascular disease, 20.3\%, and 17.3\% had a history of significant intake of alcohol and smoking, respectively. Conclusions: The prevalence of prehypertension in the community was high. It was associated with increasing age, male gender, and increasing BMI. Interventions at this stage may aid in stemming the rising prevalence of hypertension in our environment.},

This study was designed to determine the prevalence of obesity and hypertension amongst market men and women in Ijebu- Ode, Nigeria. A cross-sectional study involving 157 (52.3\%) males and 143 (47.7\%) females was conducted. Body mass index (BMI) was derived from weight and height measurements; waist circumference (WC) measurement was taken to assess abdominal obesity. Blood pressure was measured using a digital sphygmomanometer. The mean({$\pm$}S.E) age in the study was 39.04(0.658) years, mean({$\pm$}S.E) BMI, SBP and DBP were 26.36(0.32)kgm-2, 116.64(1.27)mmHg and 79.50(0.86)mmHg respectively.

  abstract = {Central obesity poses more threat to human health than general obesity and stress increases its presentation. This study assessed prevalence of central obesity and stress, and their association with hypertension. Two hundred and eighty-three health workers in Jos Teaching Hospital, Plateau State, Nigeria were randomly selected. Socio-demographic characteristics and lifestyles (physical activity, alcohol intake, smoking and stress) were evaluated by semi-structured and International Stress Management Association Questionnaire. Central obesity was determined by waist circumference. Crude overweight, obesity and blood pressure were assessed by Body Mass Index, Body fat percentage and digital sphygmomanometer respectively. Hypertension was defined as BP =140/90mmHg. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed and significance was set at p{$<$}0.05. Study participants were 32\% males and 68\% females. Mean age was 37{$\pm$}9.5years. Clinical and non-clinical workers were 37.5\% and 62.5\% respectively. Majority did not drink alcohol (78.1\%) neither smoke cigarette (97.5\%) but 55.1\% did not engage in physical fitness. Central obesity, Crude overweight/obesity, at risk waist-hip ratio, excess body fat, prehypertension, hypertension were 47.3\%, 49.5\%, 43.1\%, 61.1\%, 20.1\% and 30.1\% respectively. Large proportion (60.9\%) experienced moderate to high stress. Significant association was observed between Body Mass Index (BMI) and stress (p=0.011), Body fat and stress (p=0.025), systolic pressure and BMI (p=0.000), and diastolic pressure and BMI (p=0.000). Central obesity and stress are prevalent among health workers especially females. This predisposes them to hypertension and other metabolic disorders. Policy on appropriate workload and recreational activities for wellbeing of health workers should be promoted by Health Policy makers in Nigeria.},

Methods All adults aged 18 years or older in 10 semi-urban communities were recruited for the study. The blood pressure (BP) reading taken with a validated electronic BP monitor after at least 10 minutes of rest was used in the analysis. Hypertension was defined as BP {$\geq$} 140/90 mmHg. Results Seven hundred and fifty subjects with a mean age of 61.7 {$\pm$} 18.2 years participated in the study. The prevalence of hypertension was 55.5\%. Stage 2 hypertension was the most common, present among 225 (54.1\%) of the participants with hypertension, and 191 (45.9\%) had stage 1 hypertension. Of those with hypertension, systolic\textendash diastolic hypertension (SDH) was present among 198/416 (47.6\%), while isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) and isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) were present among 181/416 (43.6\%) and 37/416 (8.9\%), respectively. The prevalence of hypertension increased significantly with age. Conclusion The prevalence of hypertension was high in these semi-urban communities. Hence, increased awareness and integrating hypertension care into primary healthcare and other community health services in these areas may prove beneficial in ameliorating its adverse effects.},

A cross-sectional study design was employed for the community-based study. Purposive sampling was used to select 78 adults who voluntarily took part in a medical outreach organized by a Non-Governmental Organization (Living Stone Explorers) in the village. The study was carried out in Tinda village, Dukku local government area Gombe State, Nigeria. The data collected were analyzed via descriptive and inferential statistics using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20. The respondents had a mean age of 33.5{$\pm$}13.6. A statistically significant relationship was derived between hypertension and age of participants (p=0.02 for diastolic Blood pressure and p=0.07 for systolic blood pressure). The prevalence of hypertension from this study was found out to be 26.9\% which is slightly higher to that reported in other studies among rural respondents. The result from this study proposes the prevalence in the rural area is still lower compared to surveys conducted in urban areas. However, there is need for routine checks by establishments like the primary health care centers, so as to forestall moralities identified with hypertension.}

  abstract = {Background: Obesity is a well-established independent risk factor for hypertension and other cardiometabolic disorders. However, the best anthropometric index of obesity that predicts or associates strongly with hypertension and related conditions       remains controversial and inconclusive.                 Objective: This study compared the performance of eight anthropometric indices of obesity: body mass index (BMI), ponderal       index (PI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist\textendash hip ratio (WHR), waist\textendash height ratio (WHtR), body adiposity index       (BAI) and conicity index (CI) as correlates and potential predictors of risk of hypertension and prehypertension in a Nigerian       population, and also the possible effect of combining two or more indices in that regard.                 Methods: This church-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in Anambra state, south-eastern Nigeria from 2012 to 2013. A       total of 912 persons (436 male and 476 female) drawn randomly from three major cities (Awka, Onitsha and Nnewi) in the state       participated in the study. Information on demography, medical history and lifestyle were obtained using a well-structured and validated       questionnaire. The systolic/diastolic blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were taken by well-trained       personnel. The resulting data were analysed using descriptive statistics, logistic regression, Poisson regression and receiver       operating characteristic curve analysis.                 Results: The mean values of all the anthropometric indices studied increased from normotension, through       prehypertension to hypertension in both genders. BMI, WC, HC and CI were significantly higher (p {$<$} 0.05) in females than       males. All the anthropometric indices studied were significantly (p {$<$} 0.001 except for CI) correlated with systolic and       diastolic blood pressure. BMI, WHtR, WC and PI (with higher correlation coefficients for blood pressure) showed the best       potential to predict hypertension and prehypertension in the study: BMI (cut-off = 24.49, AUC = 0.698; cut-off = 23.62, AUC       = 0.659), WHtR (cut-off = 0.55, AUC = 0.682; cut-off = 0.5, AUC = 0.636), WC (cut-off = 91.44, AUC = 0.692;       cut-off = 82.55, AUC = 0.645), PI (cut-off = 14.45, AUC = 0.670; cut-off = 13.69, AUC = 0.639), in males; and BMI (cut-off       = 24.44, AUC = 0.622; cut-off = 28.01, AUC = 0.609), WHtR (cut-off = 0.51, AUC = 0.624; cut-off = 0.6, AUC =       0.572), WC (cut-off = 96.62, AUC = 0.616; cut-off = 96.52, AUC = 0.584), PI (cut-off = 16.38, AUC = 0.619; cut-off =       17.65, AUC = 0.599), in females for hypertension and prehypertension, respectively. In predicting hypertension risk, WC       and WHtR did not significantly improve the performance of BMI in the models when included using our decision rule.       Overall, CI had a very poor discriminatory power for both conditions in this study.                 Conclusion: BMI, WHtR, WC and PI emerged the best predictors of hypertension risk, and BMI, WC and PI of prehypertension risk       in this study. The combination of high-performing anthropometric indices in a model did not improve their performance. Therefore we       recommend the simultaneous but independent use of BMI and either WC or WHtR for predicting hypertension, and BMI and       WC for prehypertension risk, bearing in mind that both types of index (abdominal and general obesity) account for       different forms of obesity.},

Objective: This study determined the current pattern and correlates of hypertension among adults in some rural commu- nities in South West Nigeria. Methods: It was a descriptive cross-sectional study of 1012 individuals across 16 rural communities. The respondents' blood pressure, weight, height and waist circumference were measured. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done. Results: Among the participants, 461 (45.6\%) had hypertension out of whom 217 (47.1\%) and 244 (52.9\%) had stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension respectively. The systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures increased with age. The significant predictors of hypertension were; increasing age (p{$<$}0.001), higher waist circumference (p = 0.01) and overweight / obesity (p = 0.03). While systolic blood pressure (SBP) had the strongest correlation with age, waist circumference (WC) was the strongest correlate of diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Conclusion: Despite being a rural population, there was a high prevalence of hypertension in the study area. Keywords: Prevalence; hypertension; rural; community; Nigeria.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) is to provide an evidence-based approach to the prevention and management of hypertension. The key messages of this report are: in those older than age 50, systolic blood pressure (SBP) of {$>$}140 mmHg is a more important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor than diastolic BP (DBP); beginning at 115/75 mmHg, CVD risk doubles for each increment of 20/10 mmHg; those who are normotensive at 55 years of age will have a 90 percent lifetime risk of developing hypertension; prehypertensive individuals (SBP 120\textendash 139 mmHg or DBP 80\textendash 89 mmHg) require health-promoting lifestyle modifications to prevent the progressive rise in blood pressure and CVD; for uncomplicated hypertension, thiazide diuretic should be used in drug treatment for most, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes; this report delineates specific high-risk conditions, which are compelling indications for the use of other antihypertensive drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers); two or more antihypertensive medications will be required to achieve goal BP ({$<$}140/90 mmHg, or {$<$}130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease); for patients whose BP is {$>$}20 mmHg above the SBP goal or 10 mmHg above the DBP goal, initiation of therapy using two agents, one of which usually will be a thiazide diuretic, should be considered; regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will only be controlled if patients are motivated to stay on their treatment plan. Positive experiences, trust in the clinician, and empathy improve patient motivation and satisfaction. This report serves as a guide, and the committee continues to recognize that the responsible physician's judgment remains paramount.},

This study aims to determine the prevalence of hypertension and its relationship with general obesity in rural south-western Nigeria. Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted in two rural communities in Remo North Local Government area of Ogun State, Nigeria. Four hundred and twelve (412) participants comprising 216 (50\%) males, aged 20-70 years, were studied. Participants were screened for generalized obesity and hypertension according to standard protocols. Hypertension was defined according to the seventh report of Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of high blood pressure (JNC VII). Associations between obesity and hypertension were determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's correlation and Chi-Square tests. Results: The mean of all the blood pressure indices (systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure) increased from first to fourth quartile of body mass index (BMI) (For trend, P{$<$}0.001). The prevalence of hypertension was 32.5\% (28.6\% in males and 36.4\% in females). Compared to males, more females had systolic hypertension (45.1\% vs 33.5\%, P=0.02). The prevalence of hypertension increased with age (P{$<$}0.001 for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP); P=0.019 for isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), and BMI (X2=8.508, P=0.019 [95\% CI, 0.001-0.038]). BMI correlated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P{$<$}0.001). Conclusions: The prevalence of hypertension is high and it is positively associated with obesity in the population. Aggressive lifestyle intervention to curb obesity is necessary to prevent hypertension and future cardiovascular disease.},

Objective To investigate the prevalence of hypertension in the locality and the extent of control in diagnosed cases. Methods It is a prospective study involving interviewing. Four hundred adults aged 20 years and above selected through stratified random sampling across the various compounds called ``AMA''; a unit of settlement comprising extended families of common ancestors. A self-developed, validated and pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire on demographics, predisposing factors, and medication history was used. In addition, measurement of respondents' blood pressure, weight and height was carried out. The Body Mass Index calculated and the data were appropriately analysed. Results The response rate of questionnaire distribution was 100.0\% being interviewer administered alongside weight, height and blood pressure measurement. Majority of respondents were female. Almost half of respondents (46.5\%) had their BMI above normal, 15.3\% (61) of which falls within the obese region ({$>$}30.0kg/m2). The mean (SD) systolic blood pressure among males was 133.3 (3.2) mmHg and that of females was 127.4 (3.0) while the mean (SD) diastolic blood pressures were 86.2 (1.7) and 83.9 (2.4) for males and females respectively. Crude prevalence rate of hypertension in the community was 15.0\% (60) out of which 13.8 \% (55) were previously diagnosed. The hypertension was that of Stage I in 11.5\% (46) and Stage II in 3.5\% (14). Hypertension prevalence was slightly higher in males (18.8\%) than that of the females (12.5\%) (p= 0.0889), Relative Risk (RR)=1.500 [95\%CI 0.9422:2.388]. The prevalence rate among 40 years and above was 41.6\% (42/101) who also constituted 70.0\% (42/60) of participants with hypertension in the survey and 10.5\% (42/400) of the total. Of the previously diagnosed cases of hypertension, only 31\% (17/55) were taking their drugs during the survey and only 12.7\% (07/55) had regular adherence to medication and adequate BP control was achieved in 7.3\% (04/55). Majority of the patients on drugs (21.8\%) (12/55) were either taking methydopa as monotherapy or in combination with amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide. Other drugs being taken by patients include lisinopril, propranolol, amlodipine, atenolol, nifedipine and low dose aspirin. Conclusions The prevalence of hypertension in the semi urban community is 15.0\% with a pre-hypertension in another 23.5\%. There was poor control of blood pressure among previously hypertensive patients.},

Current projections indicate that by 2020, the largest increases in NCD deaths will occur in Africa which currently has a heavy burden of infectious diseases. The aim of this study was determine the risk factors for NCDs and prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and obesity among adults in a rural community in north-central Nigeria. A cross-sectional study was carried out among adults in Gindiri Community of Plateau State. Multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 195 respondents. A semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from the respondents and was then subjected to data analysis using Epi Info version 3.5.3.Among the respondents, 152 (77.9\%) were females and 43 (22.1\%) males with a mean age of 47.5 +/- 18.8 years. Only 44.9\% of respondents engaged in physical activity at least twice a week with a mean duration of 69 minutes per session. Forty-four percent rarely take fruits and vegetables, 18.6\% add raw salt to already-prepared meals; 82.1\% take sweet/soft drinks with 12.1\% who take at least 5 times a week, and 16.9\% take snacks daily. Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and obesity was found to be 40.2\%, 9.7\% and 27.2\% respectively. Understanding the risk factors for NCDs is vital in tackling the increasing prevalence of NCDs in rural and urban communities. Targeted interventions should also be expanded to include rural communities as well.},

  abstract = {Objectives The study was primarily aimed at estimating the prevalence of hypertension and pre-hypertension and the risk factors of hypertension in the North Indian state of Punjab. It also aimed at assessing the magnitude of undiagnosed cases of hypertension in the community and ascertaining the blood pressure control status of those on treatment. Methods A non-communicable disease risk factor survey (based on WHO-STEPS approach) was done in the state of Punjab, India in a multistage stratified sample of 5127 individuals. The study subjects were administered the WHO STEPS-questionnaire and also underwent anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Results Overall prevalence of HTN among the study participants was found out to be 40.1\% (95\% CI: 38.8\textendash 41.5\%) whereas prevalence of pre-hypertension, isolated diastolic and isolated systolic hypertension were 40.8\% (39.5\textendash 42.2\%), 9.2\% (8.4\textendash 10.0\%) and 6.5\% (5.9\textendash 7.2\%) respectively. Age group (45\textendash 69 years), male gender, social group, marital status, alcohol use, obesity and salt intake ({$>$} = 5 gms/day) were the risk factors significantly associated with HTN. Among all persons with HTN, only 30.1\% were known case of HTN or on treatment, among whom nearly 61\% had controlled blood pressure. Patients with uncontrolled BP were more frequently male, obese patients, with sedentary lifestyle and patients with diabetes. Conclusions The study reported alarmingly high prevalence of hypertension, especially of undiagnosed or untreated cases amongst the adult population, a significant proportion of whom have uncontrolled blood pressure levels. This indicates the need for systematic screening and awareness program to identify the undiagnosed cases in the community and offer early treatment and regular follow up.},

  abstract = {Background: There are indications that prehypertension precedes hypertension. Like hypertension, it is associated with increased cardiovascular risk.Objective: To determine the prevalence, awareness and correlates of prehypertension and hypertension among adults in Delta State, Nigeria. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. We recruited adults aged {$\geq$}18 years from two communities in Delta State, Nigeria, using the multi-stage sampling technique. The study instrument was a modified WHO-STEPS questionnaire.Prehypertension and hypertension were defined using the JNC-7 criteria. Ethical approval was obtained before the recruitment of participants. Results: Of the 852 adults studied, the mean ({$\pm$}SD) age was 42.64 ({$\pm$}16.07) years, females (55.9\%) and urban dwellers (55.8\%). The prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension were 42.5\% and 29.3\%, respectively; both were higheramong urban dwellers. The peak age-group for prehypertension and hypertension were 25-34 and 35-44 years, respectively. Awareness of hypertension was low; 12.0\% (102/852). Blood pressure category significantly correlatedwith age, body mass index, place of residence, level of education, employment status and fruit intake. Conclusion: The prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension in this study were high. Based on the premise that prehypertension is a precursor of hypertension and occurred more among youths, the higher prevalence of prehypertensiongives an inkling to rising prevalence of hypertension.

  abstract = {Hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease globally and one of the major cause of morbidity and mortality among adults black. Apart from secular work, many adults in our environment expend a sizeable part of their time, energy and income on activities at faith-based centres. Our study evaluated the prevalence of hypertension among adults who attend faith-based centres in Abak, a metropolitan city in Akwa Ibom State, the South-South region of Nigeria. Out of the 393 subjects assessed, 62.8\% individuals were found to have blood pressure (BP) above 140/90 mmHg, which exceeds the reported average global prevalence for hypertension. 50\% of young adults (18 \textendash{} 45 years) had blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg, 60.1 \% of the middle aged persons (46 \textendash{} 60 years) had BP above 140/90 mmHg, while 85.3\% of the elderly (above 60 years) assessed had BP above 140/90 mmHg. Sex distribution of individuals with BP{$>$}140/90 mmHg showed 55.5\% males, while 44.5\% were females. Out of the 140 young adults assessed, 42.9\% were JNC-6 stage 1, 35.7\% were pre-hypertensive, while 14.2\% had normal BP. The cause of this high prevalence of BP in Abak may be multifactoral, including ignorance and lack of health education, over-dependence on spiritual solutions on health issues and low socioeconomic status.}

We aimed to establish the best frequency of BP screening by assessing the rates and determinants of progression to hypertension. METHODS: We assessed repeated BP measurements in individuals without hypertension (BP{$<$}140/90 mm Hg) from the Framingham Study (4200 men, 5645 women; mean age 52 years) who attended clinic examinations during 1978-94. The incidence of hypertension (or use of antihypertensive treatment) and its determinants were studied. FINDINGS: A stepwise increase in hypertension incidence occurred across the three non-hypertensive BP categories; 5.3\% (95\% CI 4.4-6.3\%) of participants with optimum BP, 17.6\% (15.2-20.3\%) with normal, and 37.3\% (33.3-41.5\%) with high normal BP aged below age 65 years progressed to hypertension over 4 years. Corresponding 4-year rates of progression for patients 65 years and older were 16.0\% (12.0-20.9), 25.5\% (20.4-31.4), and 49.5\% (42.6-56.4), respectively. Obesity and weight gain also contributed to progression; a 5\% weight gain on follow-up was associated with 20-30\% increased odds of hypertension. INTERPRETATION: High normal BP and normal BP frequently progress to hypertension over a period of 4 years, especially in older adults. These findings support recommendations for monitoring individuals with high normal BP once a year, and monitoring those with normal BP every 2 years, and they emphasise the importance of weight control as a measure for primary prevention of hypertension.},

While researchers generally agree that it is necessary to examine outlier and influential case diagnostics when conducting a meta-analysis, limited studies have addressed how to obtain such diagnostic measures in the context of a meta-analysis. The present paper extends standard diagnostic procedures developed for linear regression analyses to the meta-analytic fixed- and random/mixed-effects models. Three examples are used to illustrate the usefulness of these procedures in various research settings. Issues related to these diagnostic procedures in meta-analysis are also discussed.

  abstract = {Background: The last and only national blood pressure survey in Nigeria was carried out over a decade ago in 1997, using 160/95mmHg as hypertension cut off level. The overall prevalence of hypertension recorded was 11.2\%. In recent times however isolated rural and urban blood pressure studies in parts of Nigeria, using 140/90mmHg (JNC-7) cut of level have reported prevalence rates ranging from 17.5\% to 31. 5\%. This indicates a higher and increasing burden of hypertension in the country. It is on this background that we report the pattern and distribution of blood pressure in another rural community in Rivers state as a further contribution to an updated blood pressure trends data in Nigeria.Methods: The survey was a cross sectional surveys of adult volunteers during a one day health out-reach in a rural community of Rivers state. Blood pressure, BMI, random blood sugar and urine testing were done in accordance with standard protocols. JNC-7 guidelines were adopted for the determination and grading of hypertension.Results: They were 60 males and 92 females (M/F =1:1.5) with a mean age of 48.9 + 14.8years. The subjects were mostly farmers (53.9\%) with female predominance. Their 2 mean BMI was 24.8 + 4.8kg/m2 , with 30\% of the subjects in pre-obesity level and 15.7\% with obesity. The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 129.9 + 24.3mmHg, while the mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was 76.9 + 13.1mmHg. SBP was significantly higher in males than in females (p{$<$}0.001), no significant gender difference was observed for DBP. For SBP, Pre hypertension was observed in 55(36.2\%), hypertension grade -1 in 30(19.7\%) and hypertension grade - 2 in 19(12.5\%) of the subjects. The overall systolic hypertension prevalence rate was 32.2 percent. For diastolic pressure, Pre-hypertension was observed in 49(32.2\%) of subjects, hypertension grade1 in 21(13.8\%) and hypertension grade 2 in 15(9.8\%) with an overall diastolic hypertension prevalence rate of 23.6\%. The aggregate hypertension prevalence rate in the subjects was 27.9\%. Significant protenuria was observed in 26.9\% of subjects. Correlates of elevated diastolic blood pressure were increasing blood sugar and BMI.Conclusion: The aggregate prevalence of hypertension of 27.9\% and Pre-hypertension of 34.2\% found in Barako a rural community of Rivers state is high. In addition theprevalence hypertension and cardiovascular~ risk factors such as obesity was high and significantly associated with elevated blood pressure. In view of the increasing prevalence of hypertension in rural communities in Nigeria, there is need for proper blood pressure and cardiovascular risk awareness, detection and control campaign in Nigerian rural and urban communities using community based screening and surveys.Key words: Blood pressure pattern; Barako; rural community; Nigeria.},
